                    <p class="text-left">Every school has a library and like every school, even my school has a wonderful library. A library is a very important part of a school as it helps students to gain and acquire knowledge.


                        It is the heart and soul of a school as it provides lots of information and details that students would require.


                        Our school has a very large library. There are plenty number of books in the library. We have a librarian who keeps a track of all the books that go in and out of the library. We have an exclusive library period, where we are allowed to go and read books.


                        From small story books to large reference books, journals and magazines are all available in our library. They are all arranged in different sections, so that it becomes easy for those who search for a particular book. It helps students refer notes that they are looking for and helps in cultivating a reading habit too.


                        The librarian allocates cards to students and notes down details when a book is being lend from the library. Once the reference is over, then the book needs to be returned back to the library. We children usually read small story books or Children`s Knowledge bank book, but we have seen students from higher classes, visit library and note down points that they require for their learning. They sometimes even take books from library for reference.


                        The library is usually a very quiet place and it is often seen full with students and teachers refereeing notes that they require for the respective subjects that they are looking out for. There is a separate reading room in the library where students could go and read whatever they like, but maintain silence.


                        Lots of knowledge could be acquired from a library and our school library has a great collection of books, which makes this a lot easier for students to gather information.I like my library very much and I love spending time reading books, sitting in the reading room. It is so quiet that one could really enjoy reading and also study peacefully and learn a lot of great things in the world.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">An auditorium is a room built to enable an audience to hear and watch performances. For movie theatres, the number of auditoria (or auditoriums) is expressed as the number of screens. Auditoria can be found in entertainment venues, community halls, and theaters, and may be used for rehearsal, presentation, performing arts productions, or as a learning space.Sports venues such as stadiums and racetracks also have royal boxes or enclosures, for example at the All England Club and Ascot Racecourse, where access is limited to royal families or other distinguished personalities. In other countries, sports venues have luxury boxes, where access is open to anyone who can afford tickets. Additionally, some sports venues were themselves called auditoria, such as the former Buffalo Memorial Auditorium.The audience in a modern theatre are usually separated from the performers by the proscenium arch, although other types of stage are common.

                        The price charged for seats in each part of the auditorium (known in the industry as the house) usually varies according to the quality of the view of the stage. The seating areas can include some or all of the following:

                        Stalls, orchestra or arena: the lower flat area, usually below or at the same level as the stage.
                        Balconies or galleries: one or more raised seating platforms towards the rear of the auditorium. In larger theatres, multiple levels are stacked vertically above or behind the stalls. The first level is usually called the dress circle or grand circle. The highest platform, or upper circle is sometimes known as "the gods", especially in large opera houses, where the seats can be very high and a long distance from the stage.
                        Boxes: generally placed immediately to the front, side and above the level of the stage. They are often separate rooms with an open viewing area which generally seat only a handful of people. These seats are generally considered the most prestigious of the house. A state box or royal box is sometimes provided for dignitaries.
                        Seating arrangement: Seating arrangements in an auditorium seating layout (or assembly space) will either be identified as “multiple-aisle” or “continental.”[1] These terms are commonly found in design standards manuals, building codes, and similar architectural reference documents. Each size is unique, with specific guidelines governing row size, row spacing, and exit ways. Basically, a multiple-aisle arrangement will have a maximum of 14–16 chairs per row with access to an aisle-way at both ends. In a continental arrangement, all seats are located in a central section. Here the maximum quantity of chairs per row can greatly exceed the limits established in a multiple-aisle arrangement. In order to compensate for the greater length of rows allowed, building codes will require wider row spacing, wider aisles, and strategically located exit doors. Although it would seem like more space is called for, a continental seating plan is often not any less efficient than a multiple-aisle arrangement. In fact, if it is carefully planned, a continental arrangement can frequently accommodate more seating within the same space.</p>

                                Mathematics is a methodical application of matter. It is so said because the subject makes a man methodical or systematic. Mathematics makes our life orderly and prevents chaos. Certain qualities that are nurtured by mathematics are power of reasoning, creativity, abstract or spatial thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving ability and even effective communication skills.Mathematics is the cradle of all creations, without which the world cannot move an inch. Be it a cook or a farmer, a carpenter or a mechanic, a shopkeeper or a doctor, an engineer or a scientist, a musician or a magician, everyone needs mathematics in their day-to-day life. Even insects use mathematics in their everyday life for existence.</p>
